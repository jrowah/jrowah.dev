Hello world, or better yet HOLA MUNDO!! I got hooked into Elixir, Phoenix and LiveView and said I needed by house on the internet to be built with these tools. In this blog post, I write about why and how I migrated my personal website from GatsbyJS to using Elixir and Phoenix. If you are wondering whether using Elixir and Phoenix for a simple static site is an overkill, I am here to tell you this is the best choice, or it could be <u>because</u> I now understand what I am doing as opposed to when I started using Gatsby, where I exclusively followed [<span style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">this</span>](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/getting-started/) tutorial and docs.

## Introduction

This is a _markdown_ document with support for code highlighters:

```elixir
IO.puts "hello world"
```
