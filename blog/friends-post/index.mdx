_This is a short post about some great men I met when I was in campus who would later on play a very crucial part in my journey after I decided that tech is what I wanted to get involved with. I hope that after reading this only non-tech related blog that I plan to write, you will reflect on the kind of friendships you have, learn a thing or two about true friendship, and figure out whether or not you are of value to those who call you their friend, I certainly hope I am. This piece confirms that there are still good men out there who can go out of their way to see another man succeed. My circle has always been a tight one and these guys have always been the closest and so they became family. To **Alex**, **Gilbert**,
**Peter**, and **Royman**, more life to you guys and I hope you all continue being good men._

  "Friendship in its simplest explanation is a relationship you have with a
  chosen person or people. Friends are the sisters and brothers we never had,
  and are by our side through life’s ups and downs. It feels great to celebrate
  our friends for special occasions or simply brighten their day just because."

to lever yourself up.” — Thomas J. Watson

  TRUE FRIENDS stay forever…beyond words, beyond distance, beyond time…!”

<br />
As I grow older, I learn a lot about the importance of cultivating relationships
and surrounding yourself with folks who understand what life is about, who you
never have to question, and who show up in every way. I prefer to have a few
best and genuine friends as opposed to many acquaintances and last year I
realized how life-saving this can be.

<br />

In August last year my hustle was halted by unavoidable circumstances and I
could no longer survive in the city and so I decided it was better to go back
home and figure life out from there. I was against the idea of selling my
things and moving into a smaller house although that was an option I could
have gone with. Earlier on, I had organized an impromptu lunch out with these guys and so
right about the time I was going through all this we had formed a group in
which we had started making some monthly contributions in a joint account because we
decided we wanted to invest.

<br />
By this time, we had contributed some amount in our account that we could invest
although we had not hit out target yet. Here I was now unable to keep up with my
monthly contributions, which was the exact reason why they found out I was no longer
doing good financially because I am not they type that easily opens up about what
I go through on a personal level and finds it really hard asking for help in matter
personal such as this.

<br />
So when my boys found out, they came to check up on me. Gilbert and Alex came in
separate occasions and till today I do not know whether they had discussed it prior,
but when I asked, they told me they had not talked about what each one of them had
in mind. They told me that going back home would be a set back, not only to me, but
also to what we were trying to achieve. In order to try and save the situation, they
said, during their separate visits that they would step in and do whatever they could
just so I did not go back home. While all this was happening you may wonder why I
was not asking for help because there are places from where I could have gotten it.
I could say there is a certain age which when you hit as a man you find it hard asking
for help, especially financially from your parents as you feel it actually is you
who should be giving them that assistance instead. I felt that instead of burdening
my people, the best way was to carry my things, go back home and start from there.
However, the boys would hear none of it.
<br />
During this time, I had already developed an interest in programming and was doing
a part time study on that through freecodecamp organization, although I have to admit
I barely understood any of the materials I was interacting with. However, I had finally
developed the interest and determination after failing twice previously to try and
learn how to code. Now it was a matter of when I would break through into tech, and
not a matter of if. It is the interest that I suppose my friends would later on see
and make them decide to help me walk this journey. So when they found out I was about
to leave town, they felt bad that I had not let them in while all this was going
on. They asked about what I would do regarding the interest I had developed in programming.
I told them I had planned to continue with it back at home with whatever resources
I would find, although I knew deep down that it was not going to be a walk in the
park. After it was clear that me going home would not help me, my boys informed me
they were willing to whatever it took for me to remain in town and continue that
which I had started.
<br />
I informed them that I would need six months to one year to get the skills that I
needed to get a job in tech. With this time span in mind, my boys came up with a
plan that would see me learn to code while they assisted me with the major challenge
that I would have if I chose to remain in town, my rent. They said they would share
my bills for the first three months as we waited to hit the target amount in our
group account so that we could then invest that money. So for three months I would
receive financial assistance from Gilbert and Alex and Peter also chipped in during
the second month. The second part of the plan these guys had with me was to top up
the remaining amount we had in our joint account, then invest the money so that the
profit that came in would be a replacement for the money they were giving me. And
just as they said, withing weeks all the money was there and we made the investment.
Within no time, I was getting the profits. This made me relieved in that at least
I now knew my friends did not have to include me in their financial plans.
<br />
By this time I was relieved mentally and psychologically and had dedicated all my
time into coding. I would stay indoors for a whole week just staring on my machine.
I have to admit that even during this time I was not sure whether I was doing anything
at all, or whether the things I was spending my time on were of any importance. I
managed to save some little money and had bought two courses on Udemy in January
although still most of it was still foreign to me. Now relaxed and with more than
enough time, I would spend the whole of 2022 just learning how to code. It was about
this time that I discovered a tech community called
<span style={{ color: "blue" }}>[100Devs](https://leonnoel.com/100devs/)</span>,
run by one Leon Noel which is an organization where folks learn software
engineering by working in groups on actual client projects. I would then spend
11 months with this community in addition to the other resources that I came
across, which would see me become a full stack developer and acquire skills such
as JavaScript, React, MongoDB, Express, NodeJS, Gatsby, HTML/CSS, and Tailwind.
<br />
This blog would be longer should I start mentioning every detail about how much
these guys have been key to what I am now. I just wanted to use this as a way to
appreciate them although they constantly tell me that I do not owe them anything
and that I should not feel indebted to them. My friends have shown me the true
definition of friendship and for that I am forever grateful to have met them.
Although my success has been as a result of the sleepless nights, the good times
that I denied myself just to get more time to code, and sacrifices I made for
the year 2022, this journey would not have been achieved within that short time
if it were not for them. And for that, I will forever be grateful. I hope that
after you read this, you remember just how amazing it would be if you had a
chance to make an impact in someone's life without really expecting anything out
of it. To my boys, more life to all of you and may you all continue with the
good hearts.

A Special shout out to <span style={{ color: "blue" }}>[Zemuldo](https://zemuldo.com/)</span>. There could never have been any of this without your mentorship and criticism. Bless Up!

<br />
After reading this blog I believe your realized how true friends can be life savers
and how much friendship can change your world. Being with these guys and a few more
others has made me learn a lot about friends and I would like to share five of those
lessons with you;

1. **Always make the time**; although it may be very easy to get life updates of friends thanks to the power of the internet, that should not prevent you from reaching out to those you love. Make the time for simple things such as phone calls or impromptu hang outs. <br/>
2. **Quality over quantity**. With the help of these few guys I was able to make a complete turnaround in my life. This makes realize I do not need many acquaintances but instead just a few folks with whom I share quality friendship. I have learned that it is not about the number of friends you have, but the strength of the friendships.<br/>
3. **Be aware that insecurities can get in the way of true friendship**. If you want a friendship to last, never give room to competition, jealousy and mistrusts. Instead, always want what is best for your friends which then makes any of the negative emotions I have mentioned above to be replaced by selfless caring and love. A true friend will always be genuinely happy to see you succeed. Never be jealous of their wins but instead celebrate their achievements because they do the same for you. Be aware that despite being close, you are not on the same rollercoaster in life with your friends. Therefore, rather than comparing your achievements to theirs, bear in mind that you are masters in different things, and it is those differences that make your friendship special.<br/>
4. **You don’t have to be friends with everybody**. You may have a history with someone, but I would like to tell you that it doesn’t mean you have a future. You need to know if and when to let it go because life has a lot of hardships and you would not want your friends to be the source of that. Instead of trying to force a close friendship with everyone you meet,focus on strengthening the close friendships you already have.
5. **Some secrets are better when shared if you have friends who care**. This one will not need an elaboration as I assume you have read the whole piece. Just imagine if I told the boys I was okay, when actually I was not..?

<br />

And I close by this quote: <br/>

<p style={{ color: "purple" }}>
  “A strong friendship doesn’t need daily conversation, doesn’t always need
  togetherness as long as the relationship lives in the heart, true friends will
  never part…”
