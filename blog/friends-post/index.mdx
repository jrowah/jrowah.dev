_This is a special story about some great men I met when I was in campus who would later on play a very crucial part in my journey after I decided that tech is what I wanted to get involved with. I hope that after reading this only non-tech reated blog that I plan to write, you will reflect on the kind of friendships you have and whether or not you are of value to those who call you their friend, I certainly hope I am. This piece confirms that there are still good men out there who can go out of their way to see another man succeed. My circle has always been a tight one and these guys have always been the closest and so they became family. To **Alex**, **Gilbert**,
**Peter**, and **Royman**, more life to you guys and I hope you all continue being good men._

"Friendship in its simplest explanation is a relationship you have with a chosen person or people. Friends are the sisters and brothers we never had, and are by our side through life’s ups and downs. It feels great to celebrate our friends for special occasions or simply brighten their day just because."

to lever yourself up.” — Thomas J. Watson

  > In August last year my hustle was halted by unavoidable circumstances and I
  could no longer survive in the city and so I decided it was better to go back
  home and figure life out from there. I was against the idea of selling my
  things and moving into a smaller house although that was an option I could
  have gone with. Erlier on, I had organized a meeting with these guys and so
  about the time I was going through all this we had formed a group in which we
  had started making some monthly contributions in a joint because we decided we
  wanted to invest.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  By this time, we had contributed some amount in our account that we could
  invest although we had not hit out target yet. Here I was now unable to keep
  up with my monthly contributions, which was the exact reason why my friends
  found out I was no longer doing good financially because I am not they type
  that easily opens up about what I go through on a personal level and finds it
  really hard asking for help in matter personal such as this.
</p>
<br />

<p>
  So when my boys found out, they came to check up on me. Gilbert and Alex came
  in separate occasions and till today I do not know whether they had discussed
  it, but they told me they had not talked about what follows. Each one of them
  told me they would never let me go back home, that it would be a setback to
  what we were trying to achieve. They said, during their separate visits that
  they would step in and do whatever they could just so I did not go back home.
  There is a certain age which when you hit as a man you find it hard asking for
  help, especially financially from your parents as you feel it actually is you
  who should be giving them that assistance instead. I had thought that istead
  of burdening my people, the best way was to carry my things, go back home and
  start from there. However, the boys would hear none of it.

  So after they found out, they came to check up on me. Gilbert and Alex came in
  separate occasions and to still day I do not know whether they had discussed
  it, but they told me they did not. Each one of them told me they would never
  let me go back home, that it would be a setback to what we were trying to
  achieve. They said, during their separate visits that they would step in and
  do whatever they could just so I did not go back home. These guys told me they
  would pay my rent and help with the bills. By this time I had started learning
  web development through freecodecamp.org and so they asked me if I was sure of
  what I was getting into. I said I was and told them I would need between 6
  months to a year to acquire the skills that would get me back up.
</p>
<br />
<p width="100">
  My friends said they would share my bills for three months as we waited to hit
  the target amount in our group account so that we could then invest that money
  and continue receiving the profit we would get for another 6 months until I
  got to my destination. Soon enough our group contribution was invested and we
  were getting a monthly profit that could help with my rent.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  By this time I was free enough and had dedicated all my time into coding. I
  would stay indoors for a whole week just staring on my machine. I have to
  admit that for the first three months I was not sure whether I was doing
  anything at all. I managed to save some little money and had bought two
  courses on Udemy in January although still most of it was still foreign to me.

<br />
<p>
  It was about this time that I discovered a tech community called
  <a style={{ color: "blue" }}>[100Devs](https://leonnoel.com/100devs/)</a>, run
  by one Leon Noel which is an organization where folks learn software engineering
  by working in groups on actual client projects.

A Special shout out to <span style={{ color: "blue" }}>[Zemuldo](https://zemuldo.com/)</span>. There could never have been any of this without your mentorship and criticism.
