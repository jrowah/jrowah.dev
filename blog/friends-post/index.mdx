This is a short story about three great men I met when I was in campus who would later on play a very crucial part in my journey after I decided that tech is what I wanted to get involved with. I hope that after reading this only non-tech reated blog that I plan to write, you will reflect on the kind of friendships you have and whether or not you are of value to those who call you their friend. This piece confirms that there are still good men out there who can go out of their way to see another man succeed. My circle has always been a tight one and these guys have always been the closest and so they became family. To **Alex**, **Gilbert**,
**Peter**, and **Royman**, more life to you guys and I hope you all continue being good men.

  The year was in 2021 in August when my source of income ended and I could no
  longer pay my bills and so I decided I wanted to go back home and figure life
  out from there. I was living in a big house and was against the idea of
  selling my things and moving into a smaller house. Prior, I had organized a
  meeting with my friends including two other Phil and Andrew and so about this
  time I was going through all this we had formed a group in which we had
  started making monthly contributions towards a group investment because we
  decided we wanted to invest.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  By this time, we had some amount in our account that we could invest although
  we had not hit out target yet. Here I was now unable to keep up with my
  monthly contributions, the exact reason why my friends found out I was no
  longer doing good financially because I am not they type that easily opens up
  about what I go through on a personal level and finds it really hard asking
  for help in matter personal such as this.
</p>
<br />

<p>
  So when my friends found out, they came to check up on me. Gilbert and Alex
  came in separate occasions and to still day I do not know whether they had
  discussed it, but they told me they did not. Each one of them told me they
  would never let me go back home, that it would be a setback to what we were
  trying to achieve. They said, during their separate visits that they would
  step in and do whatever they could just so I did not go back home.

  told me they would pay my rent and help with the bills. By this time I had
  started learning web development through freecodecamp.org and so they asked me
  if I was sure of what I was getting into. I said I was and told them I would
  need between 6 months to a year to acquire the skills that would get me back
  up.

  My friends said they would share my bills for three months as we waited to hit
  the target amount in our group account so that we could then invest that money
  and continue receiving the profit we would get for another 6 months until I
  got to my destination. Soon enough our group contribution was invested and we
  were getting a monthly profit that could help with my rent.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  By this time I was free enough and had dedicated all my time into coding. I
  would stay indoors for a whole week just staring on my machine. I have to
  admit that for the first three months I was not sure whether I was doing
  anything at all. I managed to save some little money and had bought two
  courses on Udemy in January although still most of it was still foreign to me.
</p>

<p>
  It was about this time that I discovered a tech community called
  [100Devs](https://leonnoel.com/100devs/), run by one Leon Noel which is an
  organization where folks learn software engineering by working in groups on
  actual client projects.
