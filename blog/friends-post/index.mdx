_This is a special story about some great men I met when I was in campus who would later on play a very crucial part in my journey after I decided that tech is what I wanted to get involved with. I hope that after reading this only non-tech related blog that I plan to write, you will reflect on the kind of friendships you have and whether or not you are of value to those who call you their friend, I certainly hope I am. This piece confirms that there are still good men out there who can go out of their way to see another man succeed. My circle has always been a tight one and these guys have always been the closest and so they became family. To **Alex**, **Gilbert**,
**Peter**, and **Royman**, more life to you guys and I hope you all continue being good men._

"Friendship in its simplest explanation is a relationship you have with a chosen person or people. Friends are the sisters and brothers we never had, and are by our side through life’s ups and downs. It feels great to celebrate our friends for special occasions or simply brighten their day just because."

to lever yourself up.” — Thomas J. Watson

  > In August last year my hustle was halted by unavoidable circumstances and I
  could no longer survive in the city and so I decided it was better to go back
  home and figure life out from there. I was against the idea of selling my
  things and moving into a smaller house although that was an option I could
  have gone with. Earlier on, I had organized a meeting with these guys and so
  right about the time I was going through all this we had formed a group in
  which we had started making some monthly contributions in a joint because we
  decided we wanted to invest.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  By this time, we had contributed some amount in our account that we could
  invest although we had not hit out target yet. Here I was now unable to keep
  up with my monthly contributions, which was the exact reason why my friends
  found out I was no longer doing good financially because I am not they type
  that easily opens up about what I go through on a personal level and finds it
  really hard asking for help in matter personal such as this.
</p>
<br />

<p>
  So when my boys found out, they came to check up on me. Gilbert and Alex came
  in separate occasions and till today I do not know whether they had discussed
  it prior, but when I asked, they told me they had not talked about what each
  one of them had in mind. They told me that going back home would be a set
  back, not only to me, but also to what we were trying to achieve. In order to
  try and save the situation, they said, during their separate visits that they
  would step in and do whatever they could just so I did not go back home. While
  all this was happening you may wonder why I was not asking for help because
  there are places from where I could have gotten it. I could say there is a
  certain age which when you hit as a man you find it hard asking for help,
  especially financially from your parents as you feel it actually is you who
  should be giving them that assistance instead. I felt that instead of
  burdening my people, the best way was to carry my things, go back home and
  start from there. However, the boys would hear none of it.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  During this time, I had already developed an interest in web development and
  was doing a part time study on that through freecodecamp organization,
  although I have to admit I barely understood any of the materials I was
  interacting with. However, I had finally developed the interest and
  determination after failing twice previously to try and learn how to code. It
  is the interest that I suppose my friends would later on see and make them
  decide to help me walk this journey. So when they found out I was about to
  leave town, they git mad that I had not let them in while all this was going
  on. They asked about what I would do regarding the interest I had developed in
  programming. I told them I had planned to continue with it back at home with
  whatever resources I would find, although I knew deep down that it was not
  going to be a walk in tha pack. After it was clear that me going home would
  not help me, my boys informed me they were willing to whatever it took for me
  to remain in town and continue that which I had started.
</p>
<br />
<p width="100">
  I informed them that I would need six months to one year to get the skills
  that I needed to get a job in tech. With this timespan in mind, these guys
  came up with a plan that would see me learn to code while they assisted me
  with the major challenge that I would have if I chose to remain in town, my
  rent. My friends said they would share my bills for the first three months as
  we waited to hit the target amount in our group account so that we could then
  invest that money. So for three months I would receive financial assistance
  from Gilbert and Alex and Peter also chipped in during the second month which
  massively offloaded the burden of rent to specific off my back. The second
  part of the plan these guys had with me was to top up the remaining amount we
  had in our joint account, then invest the money so that the profit that came
  in would be a replacement so they would not have to use their own money on me.
  And just as they said, withing weeks all the money was there and we made the
  investment. Within no time, I was getting the profits. This made me relieved
  in that at least I now knew my friends did not have to include me in their
  financial plans.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  By this time I was relieved mentally and psychologically and had dedicated all
  my time into coding. I would stay indoors for a whole week just staring on my
  machine. I have to admit that even during this time I was not sure whether I
  was doing anything at all, or whether the things I was spending my time on
  were of any importance. I managed to save some little money and had bought two
  courses on Udemy in January although still most of it was still foreign to me.
  Now relaxed and with more than enough time, I would spend the whole of 2022
  just learning how to code. It was about this time that I discovered a tech
  community called
  <a style={{ color: "blue" }}>[100Devs](https://leonnoel.com/100devs/)</a>, run
  by one Leon Noel which is an organization where folks learn software engineering
  by working in groups on actual client projects. I would then spend 11 months with
  this community in addition to the other resources that I came across, which would
  see me become a full stack developer and acquire skills such as JavaScript, React,
  MongoDB, Express, NodeJS, Gatsby, HTML/CSS, and Tailwind.
</p>

<P>
  This blog would be longer should I start mentioning every detail about how
  much these guys have been key to what I am now. I just wanted to use this as a
  way to appreciate them although they constantly tell me that I do not owe them
  anything and that I should not feel indebted to them. These guys have shown me
  the true definition of friendship and for that I am forever grateful to have
  met them. Although my success has been as a result of the sleepless nights,
  the good times that I denied myself just to get more time to code, and
  sacrifices I made for the year 2022, this journey would not have been achieved
  within that short time if it were nt for them. And for that, I will forever be
  grateful. I hope that after you read this, you remember just how amazing it
  would be if you had a chance to make an impact in someone's life without
  really expecting anything out of it. To my boys, more life to all of you and
  may you all continue with the good hearts.
