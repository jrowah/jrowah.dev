Let's build a React App from scratch! We are going to build a game called tic tac toe and in the process learn the basics of React, master them and be able to use them in any React project of our choice. I already built this game using vanilla JavaScript and you can find it under my projects page. Let's GO!

# Setting Up Local Development Environment

You will need to have NodeJS installed in your Machine.
To check if you have NodeJS installed, type node -v in the Terminal.
You can use a code editor of your choice. I use VSCode.

Once you have your development environment ready, in the terminal, we are going to run the command:
npx create-react-app tic-tac-toe-react-app (you can call your app whatever you wish, I noticed mine is a bit long)
Still in the terminal, navigate to your React application directory by running this command:
cd tic-tac-toe-react-app
Then start your React app by running:
npm start

On your browser you should be able to see (react-live.png)

Navigate to the src directory and delete all the files present by running
rm -f \*  
Or physically deleting them but DO NOT delete the entire src folder.
Once you have the files deleted, switch back to the project folder by running
cd ..

In the src folder, create an index.css file and paste this code
