      A self-taught software developer with a unique background in Biochemistry (B.Sc.) and Education (Higher Diploma, specialized in teaching Chemistry and Biology). My transition into tech has allowed me to combine my passion for problem-solving with modern technologies. I have experience working with Elixir, Phoenix, Postgres, LiveView, and TailwindCSS, along with UI libraries like Flowbite and TailwindUI.

      Fluent in English, Swahili, Luo, and un poco de espa√±ol üòÅ. I bring a diverse perspective to my work. I'm particularly interested in AI and ML, areas I am actively exploring. I know JavaScript, a bit of React, and I am learning Python.

      Outside of coding, I enjoy morning runs, cycling, swimming, cooking, and spending quality time with my daughter as I wait for her to become of age and teach me new stuff üòé.
