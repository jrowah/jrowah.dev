    As a software developer and scientist, my goal it to make the world a better place by finding modern software solutions to common and complex problems, especially scientific ones. Currently, I do so using Elixir, Phoenix, LiveView, and some JavaScript.
  </p>
  <p>
    This space is for documenting my professional growth as I explore new technologies, enhance my knowledge, and tackle these problems along the way. My primary focus is on sharing real-world experiences, whether it's diving into unfamiliar technologies or refining techniques in areas I already know, and making sure this documentation is designed to be a resource for my self and anyone who might be on a similar learning path.
